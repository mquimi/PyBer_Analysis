# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

For the PyBer project, I had to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. In order to analyze this data, we had to use different graphs and charts such as scatter plots, bar graphs, pie charts and the box and whiskers graph. 

The datasets that were provided also allowed me to calculate total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver for each of the respective city types.

Being able to provide the graphs and statistcal metrics allows stockholders to visualize the rideshare data that can help the company improve any services and even determine affordability for certain cities and neighborhoods.


###Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
###Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
