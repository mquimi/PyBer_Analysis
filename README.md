# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:

For the PyBer project, I had to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. In order to analyze this data, we had to use different graphs and charts such as scatter plots, bar graphs, pie charts and the box and whiskers graph. 

The datasets that were provided also allowed me to calculate total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver for each of the respective city types.

Being able to provide the graphs and statistcal metrics allows stockholders to visualize the rideshare data that can help the company improve any services and even determine affordability for certain cities and neighborhoods.


### Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
![summary Df]

This first image shows the total amount of drivers, fares by the type of area:Rural, Suburban, and Urban. From here you can conclude that the type "Rural" is the most expensive ride and has a lower  amount of total drivers. It makes sense why it's more expensive, due to it being far. We can predict that more people who live in rural aread have cars, meaning they won't take a cab

Sum of fares by week

This next image has a dataframe that shows the sum of fares for each of the weeks above. From here you can see that rural continues to not make so much money throughout the week, which means not that many people take cabs


### Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

- Reccomendations 1: CEO should consider removing his services from the rural areas and focus on his other two types that are bringing more economy to the company. For example, the cars that CEO will remove from rural areas can be added to the urban and suburban area, which will increase in customers and more money.

- Reccomendations 2:
- Reccomendations 3
